description: Here is what tools, software and hardware I'm currently using almost on a daily basis
---

This is a continuously changing list of the technologies, tools and hardware I use at the moment. The list will unquestionably change over time, so I'll try to update it in here as often as I can.
If you have any questions in regards to anything on this list, feel free to [get in touch with me](/contact).

#.tech
- [Ansible](https://ansible.com) is my tool of choice for deployments, configuration management and provisioning of any server I work on. My home infrastructure is deployed with Ansible, available [here](https://github.com/GeorgeGedox/infrastructure).
- [Docker](https://docker.com) for containerizing almost anything. It's my favorite way of deploying things currently.
- [borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/) for backups, simple to use, can be provisioned with Ansible, really solid.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com) anytime I need to visualize server and application metrics or even logs sometimes.
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for exporting metrics of any kind, fits perfectly with Grafana.

#.web-dev (not very active these days)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) is the web framework I use the most, I started using it at around the time version 5.2 came out and I never looked back.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) when I'm building applications relying on reactivity and user interaction.
- [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) for static sites, it lets me focus on my frontend and content instead of the underlying components. This website has been built on it.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as my starter layout skeleton or quick prototype projects. On this very website I'm using it for the grid component and a few other utilities.

#.software
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for when I'm working on complex applications. It's heavy, but it does its job very well.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for lighter projects such as creating a docker image, bash scripts or just plain text editing.
- [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) as the main OS, various Linux distibutions in VMs, MacOS for work.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) main browser with uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger and DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials extensions.
- [Adobe CC](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) for design work.

#.hardware
- My main rig contains a Ryzen 3800X AMD CPU, NVIDIA GeForge RTX 3070 graphics card, 32GB of RAM, 2.5TB of SSD storage and 2TB of HDD storage. I'm quite happy with it and I don't plan on doing any upgrades anytime soon.
- A Raspberry Pi 4 4GB that's currently used to run Home Assistant.
- An old Intel NUC with a dual-core i5-4250U CPU which acts as the reverse proxy for all my services.
- I also have a main server that I use for many things, from being a simple NAS to handling audio and video streaming, hosting my private git repository and so on. It has a Ryzen 3200G APU, 32GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage and 11TB of HDD storage.
- [Huawei Matebook D14 Laptop](https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Matebook-D14-Laptop-International/dp/B084DDBXVL) running Linux Mint 20 for portable development.

#.audio
- Currently, I'm using a pair of [Sennheiser HD 560S](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/hd-560-s-audiophile-headphone-high-end-over-ear) headphones.
- [ifi Zen Can](https://ifi-audio.com/products/zen-can/) amplifier, no DAC currently but I don't have too much noise on the wire. The XBass mode is amazing for open-back headphones.
