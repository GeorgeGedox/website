description: Here is what tools, software and hardware I'm currently using almost on a daily basis
---

This is a continuously changing list of the technologies, tools and hardware I use at the moment. The list will unquestionably change over time, so I'll try to update it in here as often as I can.
If you have any questions in regard to anything in this list, don't hesitate to [contact](/contact) me.

#.tech
- [Ansible](https://ansible.com) is my tool of choice for deployments, configuration management and provisioning of any server I work on. I mainly use it for provisioning fresh server
instances and doing small-scale deployments of docker containers and web servers. My home infrastructure is deployed with Ansible, available [here](https://github.com/GeorgeGedox/infrastructure).
- [Docker](https://docker.com) for containerizing anything, almost anything. It's my favorite way of deploying things currently.
- [borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/) for backups, simple to use, can be provisioned with Ansible, overall solid.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com) anytime I need to visualize server and application metrics.
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for server monitoring, alerts and health checks. Very flexible, has many exporters for all kinds of data, fits perfectly with Grafana.

#.web-dev
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) is the web framework I use the most, I started using it at around the time version 5.2 came out and I never looked back.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) when I'm building applications relying on reactivity and user interaction.
- [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) for static sites, it lets me focus on my frontend and content instead of the underlying components. This website is built with it.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as my starter layout skeleton or quick prototype projects. On this very website I'm using it for the grid component and a few other utilities.
I've heard of other CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Bulma but I didn't get around to using those yet.

#.software
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for when I'm working on complex applications. It's heavy, but it does its job very well.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for lighter projects such as creating a docker image, bash scripts or just plain text editing.
- [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) as the main OS, [Linux Mint 20](https://linuxmint.com/) in a VM. I would love to fully switch to Linux but I'm held back currently by 
Adobe, a piece of hardware and a few games.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger and DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials extensions.
- [Adobe CC](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) for design work.

#.hardware
- My main rig contains a Ryzen 3800X AMD CPU, nVidia GeForge RTX 3070 graphics card, 32GB of RAM, 2.5TB of SSD storage and 2TB of HDD storage. I'm quite happy with it and I don't plan 
on doing any upgrades anytime soon.
- A Raspberry Pi 4 4GB that's currently used to run Home Assistant and a DNS server, AdGuard Home.
- I also have a home server that I use for many things, from being a simple NAS to handling audio and video streaming, hosting my private git repository and so on. It has a Ryzen 3200G APU, 32GB of RAM, 
256GB of SSD storage in Raid 1 and 10TB of HDD storage.
- [Huawei Matebook D14 Laptop](https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Matebook-D14-Laptop-International/dp/B084DDBXVL) running Linux Mint 20 for portable development.

#.audio
- Currently, I'm using a pair of [Sennheiser HD 560S](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/hd-560-s-audiophile-headphone-high-end-over-ear) headphones.
- [FiiO BTR5](https://www.fiio.com/btr5) as my DAC, really loving this thing, but I'm looking to change it to something more fitting on a desk and using this only when traveling.
